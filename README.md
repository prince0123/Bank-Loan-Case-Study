# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
**Project Description:**

**Overview:**

In this project, we aim to address the challenge of loan defaults at a financial company specializing in lending. Our goal is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights within the data to inform better loan approval decisions. By analyzing past and current loan application data, we can predict potential loan defaults and improve risk management strategies.

**Data Sources:**

1. **previous_application.csv:** Contains detailed information about previous loan applications, including contract information, application details, interest rates, purposes, statuses, and client details.
2. **application_data.csv:** Provides comprehensive details about current loan applications, including client demographics, income, loan characteristics, property details, employment information, and external credit scores.
3. **columns_description.csv:** Offers descriptions for each column present in the other datasets, helping to understand the significance of the data.

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Handle Missing Data:**
   - Primary File: application_data.csv
   - Task: Identify and handle missing values, ensuring data quality and completeness.

2. **Identify Outliers:**
   - Primary File: application_data.csv
   - Task: Detect outliers in numerical columns to understand the data distribution and potential anomalies.

3. **Analyze Data Imbalance:**
   - Primary File: application_data.csv
   - Task: Examine the target variable indicating payment difficulties to assess data imbalance in loan repayment scenarios.

4. **Various Analyses:**
   - Primary File: application_data.csv
   - Secondary File: previous_application.csv
   - Task: Conduct univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

5. **Identify Correlations:**
   - Primary File: application_data.csv
   - Task: Explore correlations between different attributes and the likelihood of loan default to inform predictive models.

**Important Hypotheses:**

1. **Demographic Factors:**
   - Gender & Payment Difficulty: Differences in payment behaviors between male and female clients.
   - Income & Payment Difficulty: Challenges faced by clients with lower total incomes in making timely payments.
   - Age & Payment Difficulty: Payment difficulties among younger clients compared to older clients.

2. **Loan Characteristics:**
   - Loan Amount & Payment Difficulty: Higher loan amounts associated with increased payment difficulties.
   - Loan Type & Payment Difficulty: Cash loans potentially linked to more payment difficulties than revolving loans.
   - Loan Term & Payment Difficulty: Short-term loans possibly experiencing more initial payment difficulties.

3. **Historical Data & Behavior:**
   - Previous Applications & Payment Difficulty: Impact of multiple previous loan applications on current payment behaviors.
   - Previous Loan Approval & Payment Difficulty: Differences in payment behaviors based on past loan approval or rejection.

4. **External Factors & Creditworthiness:**
   - External Ratings & Payment Difficulty: Correlation between lower external scores and increased payment difficulties.

5. **Employment & Occupation:**
   - Employment Duration & Payment Difficulty: Shorter employment durations potentially leading to more payment difficulties.
   - Occupation Type & Payment Difficulty: Certain occupations associated with higher payment difficulties.

6. **Application Details:**
   - Application Timing & Payment Difficulty: Impact of application timing, such as weekends or late hours, on payment difficulties.

7. **Property & Realty:**
   - Property Ownership & Payment Difficulty: Differences in payment challenges between clients who own real estate or a car and those who don't.

8. **Family Status:**
   - Family Size & Payment Difficulty: Larger families possibly facing more payment difficulties.

9. **Regional Factors:**
   - Client's Region & Payment Difficulty: Variation in payment behaviors based on the client's region or regional ratings.

10. **Previous Application Details (from previous_application.csv):**
    - Previous Loan Purpose & Current Payment Difficulty: Influence of previous loan purposes on current payment behaviors.
    - Previous Loan Contract Type & Current Payment Difficulty: Impact of previous loan contract types on current payment difficulties.
    - Interest Rates & Payment Difficulty: Correlation between higher interest rates on previous loans and current payment difficulties.

11. **Client Behavior (from previous_application.csv):**
    - Previous Loan Cancellations & Current Payment Difficulty: Effect of previous loan cancellations on current payment behaviors.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them based on business context.
   - Identify and treat outliers appropriately.
   - Ensure data consistency and integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses to explore data distributions and relationships.
   - Use visualizations to gain insights into key patterns and trends.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Calculate correlation coefficients to identify relationships between variables.
   - Use these insights to generate hypotheses for further analysis.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Validate or refute hypotheses using statistical tests and data analysis techniques.
   - Draw actionable insights from the findings.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1. **Improved Loan Approval Decisions:**
   - Develop data-driven strategies for loan approvals to minimize defaults.
   - Enhance risk management practices based on identified patterns and correlations.

2. **Informed Business Strategies:**
   - Provide actionable recommendations to business stakeholders for optimizing loan products and services.
   - Enhance customer segmentation and targeting based on demographic and behavioral insights.

3. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Streamline the loan approval process by leveraging EDA findings.
   - Implement efficient risk assessment methodologies to improve operational efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

By leveraging EDA and the provided datasets, this project aims to identify critical factors influencing loan defaults. The insights gained will guide the financial company in making informed loan approval decisions, thereby reducing risks and improving overall business performance.
